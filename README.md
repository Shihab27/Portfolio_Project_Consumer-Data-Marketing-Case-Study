# Portfolio_Project_Consumer-Data-Marketing-Case-Study

The project outlined is a comprehensive analysis of consumer information in relation to sales and profits. The objective of the final assignment is to delve into two provided datasets, which the team needs to merge using Tableau, and to perform a detailed analysis across three main tasks: 

## Customer Grouping Analysis: 
- **Objective:** Group customers by various criteria including gender, location, household size, and income level.
- **Visualization Goals:** Generate horizontal bar charts to display household income by state and region, spending by state, and a gender comparison of income across different age groups.
  
## Customer Segmentation Analysis: 
- **Objective:** Study common methods of customer segmentation and apply feasible techniques on the dataset, exploring demographic, geographic, behavioral, and value-based segmentation.
- **Visualization Goals:** Use Tableau to display examples of segmentation by order frequency and sales, highlighting trends and behaviors in customer purchasing.

## Key Product Analysis: 
- **Objective:** Identify top products generating the most sales and profits, examine trends over the years and across states, and pinpoint emerging high-performing products.
- **Visualization Goals:** Present bar charts showcasing sales trends, profit trends, and product demand by state.

The final deliverable will include:
- **Executive Summary:** Summarizing the findings and strategic insights.
- **Detailed Analysis Sections:** Covering customer structure, segmentation, and key product performance.
- **General Conclusion and Discussion:** Reflecting on the learnings from the dataset analysis.

This structured approach ensures a thorough examination of consumer behavior and product performance, catering to strategic business needs.
